Post-History  

This document describes the known bit allocations and message IDs for the BitTorrent protocol. To request a bit allocation contact <editor@bittorrent.org>. Contact the same address if you are aware of any omissions.

# Reserved Bit Allocations

    reserved[0]
    0x80  Azureus Messaging Protocol

    reserved[2]
    0x08  BitTorrent Location-aware Protocol (no known implementations)

    reserved[5]
    0x10  LTEP (Libtorrent Extension Protocol)
    0x02  Extension Negotiation Protocol
    0x01  Extension Negotiation Protocol

    reserved[7]
    0x01  BitTorrent DHT
    0x02  XBT Peer Exchange 
    0x04  suggest, haveall, havenone, reject request, and allow fast extensions
    0x08  NAT Traversal
    0x10  hybrid torrent legacy to v2 upgrade

There are known collisions:

    reserved[0]
    0xFF  BitComet Extension Protocol

    reserved[1]
    0xFF  BitComet Extension Protocol

    reserved[7]
    0x01  XBT Metadata Exchange (implemented only in XBT)

It is recommended that further extensions use the Extension Protocol [^1], a.k.a., LibTorrent Extension Protocol (LTEP). With LTEP, extension bit collisions become impossible since no new extension bits are allocated. With LTEP, message ID collisions also become impossible because message IDs are allocated on demand at the beginning of the connection. Extension *name* collisions become possible, but the probability is much less likely.

# Reserved Message IDs

    Core Protocol:
    0x00   choke
    0x01   unchoke
    0x02   interested
    0x03   not interested
    0x04   have
    0x05   bitfield
    0x06   request
    0x07   piece
    0x08   cancel

    DHT Extension:
    0x09   port

    Fast Extensions:
    0x0D   suggest
    0x0E   have all
    0x0F   have none
    0x10   reject request
    0x11   allowed fast

    Additional IDs used in deployed clients:
    0x14   LTEP Handshake (implemented in libtorrent, uTorrent,...)

    Hash Transfer Protocol:
    0x15   hash request
    0x16   hashes
    0x17   hash reject

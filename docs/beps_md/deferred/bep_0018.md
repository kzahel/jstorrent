Post-History  

# Rationale

The .btsearch file specifies the structure through which the client can conduct searches on torrent search engines. By publishing a simple .btsearch file, search engines can easily be added to a client's built-in torrent search box.

# Formatting

The .btsearch file is based on a subset of the broader [OpenSearch description document](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch), and consists of the following elements.

## OpenSearchDescription element

The root node of the .btsearch document:

    Parent: None
    Requirements: Must appear once as the root node

## ShortName element

Contains a short human-readable name for the search engine:

    Parent: OpenSearchDescription
    Requirements: Must appear exactly once

## Description element

Contains a human-readable description of the search engine:

    Parent: OpenSearchDescription
    Requirements: Must appear exactly once

## Url element

Describes structure through which search requests are made:

    Parent: OpenSearchDescription
    Requirements: Must appear exactly once
    Attributes: template - specifies a parameterized template URL for the
    search query, in which {searchTerms} is replaced by the URL-encoded 
    user-supplied query.

# Example

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <OpenSearchDescription>
    <ShortName>BitTorrent</ShortName>
    <Description>Search torrents on BitTorrent.com</Description>
    <Url template="http://www.bittorrent.com/search?q={searchTerms}&category=All"/>
    </OpenSearchDescription>

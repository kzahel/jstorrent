# Abstract

This extension enables torrents to update based on data stored in the BitTorrent DHT[^1], rather than an HTTP server. The publisher has control over when the torrent is updated, and which content it contains, via mutable DHT items. It is similar to BEP 39[^2], with the difference being that it uses the DHT to notify and be notified about updates of a torrent, hence should provide more decentralized capabilities to both publishers and consumers.

The intention is to allow publishers to serve content that might change over time in a more decentralized fashion. Consumers interested in the publisher's content only need to know their public key + optional salt. For instance, entities like Archive.org could publish their database dumps, and benefit from not having to maintain a central HTTP feed server to notify consumers about updates.

# Rationale

BEP 39[^3] allows to automatically update torrents based on HTTP URLs. With DHT storing capabilities[^4], we can implement similar functionality in a more decentralized fashion without resorting to central HTTP servers, and using features already present in the BitTorrent network (mainly DHT store).

# Publishing content

Publishers should issue a mutable `put` request when they want to notify consumers about an update of a torrent. The value of the payload `v` contains a dictionary with key `ih` (info hash) and value the 20 byte infohash of such torrent. Note that while a DHT entry under a particular key maps to a single torrent at any given moment, many different keys can point to the same torrent.

<div class="parsed-literal">

{  
... "v": { "ih": "\<20-byte infohash of target torrent\>" }

}

</div>

For request and response details refer to BEP 44[^5].

# Consuming content

Consumers issue a `get` request using the target ID of the mutable item they are interested in. Periodically polling such ID by issuing `get` requests to see whether the `v` property of the response has updated. If an update is found, the torrent can be updated using the infohash found in the response.

Both publisher and consumer should periodically `put` the mutable items they have active to keep them alive in the DHT. For details on the republish algorithm see[^6].

# Magnet link

`magnet:?xs=urn:btpk:[ Public Key (Hex) ]&s=[ Salt (Hex) ]`

Note that `xs` ("exact source") is used instead of `xt`, and that the salt `s` is optional.

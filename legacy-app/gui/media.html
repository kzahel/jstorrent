<p>Important - on a Chromebook, you'll get better performance when
saving to an external drive, since the internal disk is encrypted,
which is slower.<p>

<p>If you get an error, try reloading this page</p>
<p>If you seek to a portion of the file that is not yet downloaded, it will prioritize downloading from that area. Please note that this feature is new and in beta. It can take a while for the file to be ready for streaming, and you may need to manually pause it so that the <span style="color:0a0">green</span> downloaded bar has downloaded enough data.</p>

<p>Also, for HD videos, your computer likely will not be fast enough to download and play the video at the same time.</p>

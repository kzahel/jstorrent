# JSTorrent Native Messaging Host - Artifacts

**Generated by**: Antigravity AI  
**Date**: 2025-11-20  
**Version**: 0.1.0

## Overview

This directory contains the artifacts and documentation generated during the development of the JSTorrent Native Messaging Host. The host is a Rust binary designed to act as a safe, minimal syscall proxy for the JSTorrent Chrome extension.

## Creation Process

The project was developed through the following agentic workflow:

1.  **Design Review**: The agent reviewed `design.md` to understand the requirements (TCP/UDP, File I/O, Safety).
2.  **Planning**: An `implementation_plan.md` was created and approved by the user.
3.  **Implementation**:
    - Initialized a Rust project with `tokio`, `serde`, and other dependencies.
    - Implemented the Native Messaging protocol (length-prefixed JSON).
    - Implemented core features: TCP/UDP sockets, File I/O, Atomic Move, Folder Picker, Hashing.
    - Implemented strict path safety (`path_safety.rs`) to confine operations to a download root.
4.  **Verification**:
    - Wrote unit tests for IPC and Path Safety.
    - Created and ran an end-to-end integration test script (`verify_host.py`) in Python.
    - Verified all features worked as expected.
5.  **Archival**: These artifacts were collected here for record-keeping.
